# Mini Project Three Cup Monte

This is mini project call Three Cup Monte.

Yes we will not see any cup or ball we are going to mimic the game.

The ball is represented by the capital letter 'O'.

I have used the shuffle function from the random module.

The program is very simple go through it and you will understand it.

Added docstring and comments wherever it is necessary.
